**Predicting Building Energy Use with Machine Learning**

This project predicts building energy consumption (cooling and heating loads) based on physical design factors such as wall height, roof size, and climate conditions. Using a dataset from research by Tsanas and Xifara, machine learning models were trained to estimate energy use with high accuracy. The project also includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. A web app was built for easy interaction, allowing users to input building design variables.
